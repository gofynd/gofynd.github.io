<p>Soap services are quite heavy weight and can be tedious to work with. Though these services are still important assets to many organisations it would be much easier to work with JSON rather than working with SOAP which is xml based( its no fun! ). With Stark — A lightweight java service you can easily consume SOAP web services and transform it into REST APIs. Stark enables you to provide a SOAP WSDL URL and it returns you it’s REST transformed end-points.</p>
