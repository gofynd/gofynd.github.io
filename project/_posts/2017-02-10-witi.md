<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
Witi is a service that makes it easy to automatically tags all your e-commerce specific catalogue images, so you can quickly organize, manage, and search through your content. With Witi, you can detect ecommerce specific product attributes like sleeve length, pattern, neck type, product category and more.

</p>

<p>

Witi API enables you to quickly add sophisticated deep learning-based visual search and image classification to your applications. Currently its in beta version so we are allowing free api access to limited number of model's, In coming month we will be sharing full free api access to find content by visual similarity, keyword tag, or a combination of both so you can serve powerful image-based recommendations.

</p>

 
<h3>How To Use</h3>
<p>

You can call the Witi API with the specific model. Simply pass in an image input with a publicly accessible URL or by directly sending image bytes as form data.
